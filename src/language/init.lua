-- a little note on what std. actually is right now:
-- std.inside
-- std.repr ( What does this mean? Literally: LNK(!,std.repr,?) )
-- std.quality ( What is this? What is this a? )
-- std.perf ( When something does something... )
-- std.cause ( When something leads to something else (this standard is backwards) )
-- std.owns?

--[[ Actions in language will not follow standard english grammatical rules as with previous archives.
 Abstraction is important to facilitate truly effective language.memory.communication, for example, what if I missed out a word or didn't understand english well?
 Therefore, all actions in my third language model will operate under the premise that this system is communicating with a developing child.
